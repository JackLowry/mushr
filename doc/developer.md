# Developer docs

This document describes information primarily important for MuSHR developers. In MuSHR, we use "developer" to describe contributors to the main MuSHR repository, or to any of the main ROS packages referenced in our .rosinstall files, demos, or (in many cases) launch files. Use this document as a guide to understand code conventions, expectations about test automation, and templates for writing the `README.md` docs that must accompany any new code or launch file submission.
